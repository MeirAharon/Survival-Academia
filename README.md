# Survival-Academia
This is my CMU term project for 15-112 
This game is similar to mario but it it is about a student
who is trying to get to class and must dodge or defeat distractions on their way there.

The main file to run is loadGame.py

I am using cmu graphis which can be downloading from their websited.

for easier play through you can  go to line 165 in the player file and turn off the die on collision with enemies line by commenting it out.

nothing else needs to be installed for this game to run
